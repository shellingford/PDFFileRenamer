PDF file renamer

If you have many different articles stored in pdf with semi-random names like 
"0611032v1.pdf" or "fasc0a.pdf" and are too lazy to rename them individually
then this tool might help you :)

The idea is to find the 'title' as text with biggest centered font on the first 
page and rename the file with it.

It's been tested only on win7 (for now) and works only for pdfs which text can
be read by pdfbox lib.
